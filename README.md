Wildland fires have the potential to play an important role in the dispersal of microbes, including plant and human pathogens. The structure of microbial assemblages transported in smoke from wildland fires depends on several factors, such as the community of microbes in fuel, propagule shape and weight, and capacity to survive fires. Our objective in this study is to characterize the potential fungal pathogens in smoke from wildland fires, along with the associated fungal assemblage. Using a DJI Matrice hexacopter unmanned aircraft system we sampled wildland fire smoke in five locations in the Western USA. Metagenomic analysis was performed based on sequencing the fungal ITS region, and culture-based techniques were used to detect the viable fungi. We found putative plant pathogenic genera such as Alternaria, Epicoccum, Botrytis and Cladosporium, and putative human pathogens like Coccidioides and Cryptococcus. We compare association networks from fungal assemblages at the five locations, as a first step toward understanding potential predictors of pathogen abundance and how smoke assemblages are formed. The One Health framework addresses interactions such as these, where plant and soil systems can be a source of both human and plant pathogens.
